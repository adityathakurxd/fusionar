# AR Fusion
Imagine you’ve started a new business, opened a new store. 
What are the 3 biggest challenges you think you’ll face?

 - Accuring Customers 
 - Managing Inventory 
 - Cash Flow generation (also known as Working Capital)

What if I tell you, we can deal with almost all three with a single product?
And even take care of the environment for you :)

**Is that even possible?**
Surprising isn’t it?

## What is it?

We at ARfusion are providing an AR solution to the world. 
This solution will provide an efficient, never before seen **inventory management system**.

*Who needs inventory when we have technology with us?*

## Working
We aim to provide our users to step into a digital world and show their customers a preview of how their spaces would look like, be it living rooms, bathrooms, or their bedrooms. 

The customers, with the help of AR, can view all the things they wish to buy in the palm of their hands using their smartphones.
